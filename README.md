# Simple PasswordManager

written in Swift 3 and Xcode 8.3

Build for iPhone iOS 10.x

Status: <b>Check out and play with it! (User/PW -> test/test)</b> ✔︎🙃

Notes: <br /> This is just a fun project so I highly recommend not to use this app for your daily stuff because the passwords aren't crypted. So they are clear to read. ⚠️
<br /> Logo and Name on the Loginscreen are fictional. ⚠️
